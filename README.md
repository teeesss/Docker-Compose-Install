Docker Compose Installation Script for Synology NAS


Example of the output

```
./docker-compose-install.sh
--- Docker Compose Updater v3.0 ---
--- 1. Checking Prerequisites ---
All dependencies are satisfied.

================================= IMPORTANT ==================================
NOTE: You are running this on a Synology NAS.
Updating the 'Container Manager' package from the Package Center will
likely OVERWRITE the docker-compose version you install with this script.
If that happens, simply run this script again.
